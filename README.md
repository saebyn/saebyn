# Hey there, I'm Saebyn! 👋

## About Me

I like solving problems, building systems, and learning new things. I love building powerful UIs, deep data visualizations, and scalable backend services.

I'm a developer who loves creating tools that simplify workflows for streamers, automate video production, and integrate AI into creative projects. **Rust** is my main focus as a language I'm trying to get better at, but I also work extensively with **TypeScript** and **Python**.

My GitHub projects reflect my passion for automating complex processes and making it easier for creators to focus on what they do best: creating content!

## Current Work

- **Video Editing Automation**: Tools to cut, splice, and enhance videos directly from stream recordings.
- **Stream Management Tools**: Solutions to organize, highlight, and transcribe stream VODs automatically, using AI to identify highlights and suggest chapters.
- **Learning Godot**: Venturing into game development with Godot, getting back into some basic game development with some simple game projects for practice

## What's Next?

I’m actively working on my current projects but already brainstorming a few new directions, and I’d love your input on what you find most exciting or valuable:

- **Mock APIs for AI Testing**: Experimenting with tools that generate mock responses for developers working with AI-driven APIs.
- **Enhanced AI Integrations**: Exploring deeper transcription accuracy, highlight detection, and context-aware insights.
- **Godot Game Experiments**: Venturing into game development with Godot, testing out interactive storytelling features and AI-driven gameplay mechanics.

If you have ideas or suggestions, feel free to reach out! I’m always open to hearing about interesting collaborations or new challenges.

## Why Your Support Matters

Your support helps me:

- Dedicate more time to open-source projects, ensuring frequent updates and improvements.
- Cover hosting costs, making my tools easier for others to try and use.
- Experiment with new ideas, from integrating better AI models to creating more efficient workflows.

Every bit of support directly contributes to making creative workflows easier and more efficient for streamers and content creators.
